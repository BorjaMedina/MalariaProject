QUESTIONS
1. Do you think that in a phylogenetic tree the parasites that use similar hosts will group together?
Not neccesarily. For example it could have occur zoonosis processes and theefore be more simialrities between species wi>

2. With the new genome file, make a gene prediction. You will probably still have some scaffolds that derive from the bi>
Because maybe when fitlering by the GC content we have left sequences with bird origin. Some specific bird sequences mig>


3.Insert the missing data in the above table. Use bash, not internet!

4. Compare the genome sizes with other eukaryotes and bacteria.Discuss with your partner (that is student partner) the reason for the observed genome sizes.
The typical genome size in bacteria is around 5 million basepairs. Yeast usually have a bigger genome size (around 12 million basepairs). Protozoa (as Plasmodium) varies between 10 and 100 megabases. Plasmodium is betwenn thsi range. Is normal that bacteria have much smaller genome size, they dont have introns and their genomes are less complex.

5. What may cause the biased GC-contents in some of the species?
The biased content in GC might be due to a different evolution history. 

6. What does the curly braces notation stand for?
The curly notation is to define all the different possible names. It says look for everyuthing between the brackets.

7. Compare how many BUSCOs (orthologues proteins) that are found in each proteome. Do the investigated parasites have close to complete numbers of BUSCOs?
Ht: 290
Pb: 351
Pc: 429
Pf: 436
Pk: 432
Pv: 435
Py: 434
Tg: 3 (381 with duplicates)

In Toxoplasma gondii there are only 3, this is normal becuase its the outgroup so its normal there are more differences. laso a lot of them are duplicated. This also makes sense becuas erit has the biggest genome of all 8 species.
The rest of Plasmodium are closer to the whole number of BUSCO (around 450)

8. Do you think that the assembly of the Haemoproteus tartakowskyi genome is a reasonable approximation of the true genome?
It has found much less number of BUSCO genes. The length and the number of genes its similar to the rest of the specis although a bit smaller. Therefore we probably are loosing some genes in our assembly.  

9. How many of the BUSCOs are found in all eight organisms?
206 (counting with the duplicates for Tg)

10. If Toxoplasma is removed, how many BUSCOs are shared among the remaining seven species. Interpret!
11. Does all protein trees reflect the “true’ ’ species tree?
No. We cannot really know the true topology. We can get the copnsense but it doesn't have to be the true one. We are going to look for the most common tree.

12. What is the phylogenetic position of Plasmodium falciparum?
Inside the Plasmodium group is the first one to differentiate creating its own branch.

13. Do you think that the GC contents have an impact on the tree topology?
Cause or consequence? Probably the GC content is the consequence of a similar evolution between species. 

14. Do you think that the host range has an impact on the tree topology?
I think it's quite important, and we can see that they kind of cluster together following the host species. 

15. Are the BUSCO proteins also found as orthologs in the proteinortho output?

16. Make a script that concatenates the alignments for each organism and BUSCO into one fasta file that in the end should contain seven sequences. Alternatively, use bash.
17. Make a tree of this “superalignment’ ’. Does it correspond to the consense tree?
